      Iâ€™m a graduate student in computer science with diverse interests and a
      versatile skill set. I believe that the science of simplicity accompanied
      by intuitive design always creates a sense of comfort to the user. My goal
      as a developer is to use my ideas, code and engineering to improve the
      lives of others.
